# How do I describe

## Conductive layers such as copper, carbon or silver
Aliases:
### as a specification
You describe both rigid and flexible conductive layers under the layers section of a product. Each layer must be represented by one item, so a four layer board should have four items under layers with the function being "conductive". You also need to describe the material, e.g. copper. A conductive layer can have a lot of attributes, so make sure that you read the [documentation](/README.md#layer-functions-and-their-attributes).


## Final finish
Aliases: Surface finish, finish, surfacefinish, finalfinish
### as a specification
You describe one or more final finishes under the layers section of a product. Each final finish must be represented by one item with the function being "final_finish". You also need to describe the material, e.g. ENIG. A layer of final finish can have a lot of attributes, so make sure that you read the [documentation](/README.md#layer-functions-and-their-attributes).
