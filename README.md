# openpcbXML
An open XML standard for communicating information needed for PCB manufacturability. Can be used to interchange information on the specification (manufacturing data only), a profile (requirements and default values when exchanging data) and capabilities (the production facility capabilities of a supplier).

## Structure of the XML
Within the root level (openpcbxml) everything is divided into four groups and their subgroups:

- specification
  - summary (listed in any order)
  - layers (listed top-down, include at least one conductive layer to determine placement in stack-up)
- profile
  - defaults
  - enforced
  - restricted
- capability
  - summary
  - materials
- custom
  - colors

## Data formats
- Percentage - Denotes a percentage - all percentages are expressed as percent out of 100- for example 10.4% is written as "10.4" and not "0.104"
- List - The data has only a fixed number of values that are selected from the list in the description table for the tag.  These items are case sensitive, and no other values are allowed.
- Text - The data is free format text.  For multiline entries, line breaks will be preserved where possible and the text may be truncated on import if the text is too long for the importing program to store.  Multiline entries may be split with either a newline (Unix format) or a carriage return – newline combination (DOS format).  Importing programs should accept either.
- Boolean - May be either TRUE or FALSE, with TRUE and FALSE in capitals.  A default value should be specified for optional fields - the default is used if the value is not present.
- Integer - An integer number with no decimal point.  May include negative values - examples include ...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,...
- Floating Point - A floating point number, usually expressed in its simplest form with a decimal point as in "1.2", "0.004", etc...  Programs shall endeavor to store as many significant digits as possible to avoid truncating or losing small values.

## abbreviations
Used in the tables below, they carry the following meaning:

- "O": Optional
- "R": Required
- "F": Forbidden

## Possible elements
The name of the element as it is to be used in the XML is included behind the title within the parenthesis, e.g. "soldermask". When a table of possible elements is present, you will find the following headers:

- "Data tag": The name of the elements
- "Format": The format of the element (possible formats listed above)
- "S": When used in a Specification part of the XML (see above for structure and abbreviations)
- "P": When used in a Profile part of the XML (see above for structure and abbreviations)
- "C": When used in a Capability part of the XML (see above for structure and abbreviations)
- If the element have alternative names in everyday use, this is referenced as an "Alias" and stated just below the title.
