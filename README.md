# Open Trade Transfer Package: Printed Circuits Fabrication Data
An open standard for communicating information needed for PCB fabrication. Can be used to interchange information on the specification (fabrication data only), a profile (requirements and default values when exchanging data) and capabilities (the production facility capabilities of a supplier). It can also be used to exchange a material list or other needed related data.

## Based on the Open Trade Transfer Package format
[Open Trade Transfer Package](https://github.com/elmatica/Open-Trade-Transfer-Package) defines a structure on how the information is to be passed in either JSON or XML format. Printed Circuit data should be placed within an element called "printed_circuits_fabrication_data" and also contain a version. Printed Circuit data can be placed within the following subelements:

- products
- profile
  - defaults
  - enforced
  - restricted
- capability
  - summary
  - materials

You can also place custom elements in the appropriate folder, such as colors and materials.

## Version
Current version is 0.1. This should stated in every section directly below the "printed_circuits_fabrication_data" element in an element called "version". 0.1 is the first released version, and there are no prior versions.

## Example
This example shows how to specify how to set a company profile that forbids production of printed circuit boards in countries that are not NATO members. More examples can be found in the examples folder.
```
{
  "open_trade_transfer_package": {
    "version": "0.1",
    "information": {

            "nato_member": false
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## abbreviations
Used in the tables below, they carry the following meaning:

- "O": Optional
- "R": Required
- "F": Forbidden

## Possible elements
The name of the element as it is to be used in the file is included behind the title within the parenthesis, e.g. "soldermask". When a table of possible elements is present, you will find the following headers:

- "Data tag": The name of the elements
- "Format": The format of the element (possible formats listed in the Open Trade Data Package format specification )
- "P": When used in a Product part of the file (to give a specification) (see above for structure and abbreviations)
- "PD": When used in a Profile->Defaults part of the file (see above for structure and abbreviations)
- "PE": When used in a Profile->Enforced part of the file (see above for structure and abbreviations)
- "PR": When used in a Profile->Restricted part of the file (see above for structure and abbreviations)
- "C": When used in a Capability part of the file (see above for structure and abbreviations)

If the element have alternative names in everyday use, this is referenced as an "Alias" and stated just below the title.
