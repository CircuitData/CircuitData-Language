# openpcbXML
En open XML standard for communicating information needed for PCB manufacturability

## Structure of the XML
Within the root level (openpcbxml) everything is divided into five groups:
- specification
- profile
- capability
- custom

### Specifications
Specifications are divided into new subsections
- layers
- standards
- markings
- dimensions
- Array (panel)

#### Layers
Layers are always listed top down for machine readability. There needs to be one conductive layer defined at the very least, so that placement on top or bottom can be determined.

#### Standards
Listed in any order, these are the required standards to meet.

#### Markings
Listed in any order, these are the necessary markings.

#### Dimensions
The physical dimensions of the board

#### Array
The description of the array/panel

## Possible elements

### Soldermask

Data tag | Format | Description
---------|--------|-------------
*color* | List or Custom | This describes the color of the soldermask based on the name of the color; green, black, blue, red, white, yellow. If a specific color needs to be defined, this can be done with RGB or HEX in the `<custom><colors>` section.
*finish* | List | Can be `matte`, `semi-matte`, `glossy` or `any`
*material* | Material |Â The material needs to listed in the materials section

##### Example 1
Where just one top soldermask layer is listed as a specification, and standard LPI is the material
```
<specification>
  <layers>
    <soldermask>
      <color>green</color>
      <finish>any</finish>
      <material>standard-lpi</material>
    </soldermask>
    <conductive>...</conductive>
  </layers>
  <materials>
    <soldermasks>
       <standard-lpi>
         <name>Standard LPI</name>
         <ipc-sm-804-class>T</ipc-sm-804-class>
       </standard-lpi>
    </soldermasks>
  </materials>
</specification>

```
